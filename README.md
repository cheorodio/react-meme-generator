# React.js Random Color Generator

## About the Project 📚
This is an upLeveled bootcamp project that challenges me to design and develop a meme generator web application using React. This application allows the user to choose their own meme template from the 10 options provided, they can choose to download the image alone of add some texts on the top and/or bottom of the image.

## Technologies ⚛️
I used React to develop this project

## Setup 💻
- Download or clone the repository
- Run `pnpm start`
  - This runs the app in the development mode.
  - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  - The page will reload when you make changes.
  
## Approach 🚶🏻‍♀️
In order for me to develop this porject, I needed to see a visual result and so I resorted to Figma and designed the prototype. I then created a flowchart to give me better understanding of how each interaction should run in my application.
